# Prism - A Dynamic Project Management Experience

Prism transforms traditional task tracking into a visually rich, intuitive experience. It's not just another kanban boardâ€”it's a spatial, interactive workspace that adapts to users' thinking patterns and workflow styles.

## Key Features

- **Spatial Organization**: Arrange tasks in non-linear, spatial relationships that better represent project dependencies.
- **Time Visualization**: Tasks visually shift in appearance/position as deadlines approach.
- **Contextual Intelligence**: Tasks adapt their visual presentation based on content type.
- **Collaboration Enhancements**: Innovative approach to showing who's working on what through ambient indicators.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js for the application framework
- TypeScript for type safety
- Framer Motion for fluid animations and transitions
- Three.js for advanced visual elements
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for state management
